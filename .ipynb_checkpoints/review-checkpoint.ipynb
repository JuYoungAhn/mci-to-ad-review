    "> Amyloid PET scans are increasingly used in clinical settings, and tracers for tau PET are being developed.Fortunately, our results regarding prediction models demonstrate that decent predictive accuracy can be achieved from readily accessible data. The key to future research in the field of dementia might be the incorporation of advanced techniques into research models as well as ensuring such models are ready and available for use in clinical practice.\n",
